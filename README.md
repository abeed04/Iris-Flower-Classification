This Project is thorugh application of machine learning with python programming. It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools.
<br>
As the data was clean and equally distributed among all the classifications of flower, EDA part was easy to go.
<br>
Using train test split splitted the data for training and testing phases(8:2).
<br>
Logistic Regression algorithm has been used for this classification because it outperforms while it is about classification.
