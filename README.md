This Project is thorugh application of machine learning with python programming. It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools.
As the data was clean and equally distributed among all the classifications of flower, EDA part was easy to go.
Using train test split splitted the data for training and testing phases(8:2).
Logistic Regression algorithm has been used for this classification because it outperforms while it is about classification.
