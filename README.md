This Project is thorugh application of machine learning with python programming. It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools.
<br>
The data was classified into three categories:
<br>
<br>
1.Iris Versicolor
<br>
2.Iris Setosa
<br>
3.Iris Virginica
<br>
<br>
As the data was clean and equally distributed among all the classifications of flower, EDA part was easy to go.
<br>
After complteting EDA part, the data was split into training and testing(8:2) using the train test split approach.
<br>
Since the logistic regression technique works better when it comes to classification, it has been employed for this particular categorization.
